Attached is core.ipynb which is a interactive jupyter notebook which uses beautiful soup four to webscrape the data. Further imports such as Seaborn are used to plot the data.

The overall goal was to answer these 4 questions as presented in the file.

1. Which two citys show the most correlation in terms of high temperature.

2. What is the average humidity of the cities for the last five of the 10 days.

3.  What is the least windy day out of the 10 days.

4. Which city has the most "sunny" days over the next 10 days.
